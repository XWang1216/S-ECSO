# S-ECSO

This MATLAB code is written by the [PlatEMO](#https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) framework.

MOEA-NZD proposes a new perpective in solving ***sparse large-scale multi-objective*** optimization problems by introducing the idea of sub-gradient into sparse optimization, with complete theoretical derivation

This code is from the paper 'An Enhanced Competitive Swarm Optimizer With Strongly Convex Sparse Operator for Large-Scale Multiobjective Optimization', published in 'IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION'.
